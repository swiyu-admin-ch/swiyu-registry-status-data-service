# Datastore Services and Libraries

The datastore services are the backbone of the Swiss SSI inspired ecosystem.
This repository does contain the current implementation for the status registry.

## Overview

For a general overview of the public beta environment and its components, please check
the [Public Beta context](https://swiyu-admin-ch.github.io/open-source-components/#public-beta).

This service provides all the protocol conform read operations.

The write operations are done in the [swiyu-core-business-service](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-core-business-service).

## Installation

To install docker please follow the instructions on the respective pages.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting the service with the local profile does not connect the data and authoring services. It only serves to start this service locally.

In order to start the service locally, run:

```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

The openapi definition can then be found [here](http://localhost:8290/swagger-ui.html)

Note: if you want to run the application alongside with the other services of SWIYU, you can run

```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local,shared
```

This will assume that the swiyu-core-business-service was already started the same way (which provides the DB at port 5280 via
its docker-compose config).

## Usage

### Secrets config

Due to the necessity of local secrets for development there might be profiles used in the run configurations 
which are not part of this repository. Those profiles are generated outside of this repository and provided
to the application als `application-*.yaml` files in the root `/config` directory or directly via environment 
variables.

### Auth

The data service is always unprotected as all data on the registers should be readable by everyone.  
The swiyu-core-business-service do need protection, which is as of now handled by the infrastructure.  
We do recommend to add mTLS authentication to your infrastructure endpoints.

## Contributions and feedback

The code for this repository is developed privately and will be released after each sprint. The published code can therefore only be a snapshot of the current development and not a thoroughly tested version. However, we welcome any feedback on the code regarding both the implementation and security aspects. Please follow the guidelines for contributing found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
